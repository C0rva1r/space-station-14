/*
 * Ok this file's just a giant TODO list for the Godot port now.
 * SO HERE'S THE LIST:
 *  Re-add cool splash screen.
 *  Some way to hook shutdown (IoCManager.Clear() needs it)
 *  Fix that HORRIBLE hack inside PathHelpers.ExecutableRelativeFile()
 *  Resource Cache doesn't use VFS, so no ZIP support.
